# Experiment with Gaussian Discriminators
Implemented Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):
1. Created two functions in Python: ldaLearn and qdaLearn which take a training data set (a feature matrix and labels) and return the means and covariance matrix.
2. Implemented two functions ldaTest and qdaTest which return the true labels for a given test data set and the accuracy using the true labels for the test data.
3. Trained both methods using the sample training data.
4. Reported the accuracy of LDA and QDA on the provided test data set and plotted the discriminating boundary for linear and quadratic discriminators.
#### Tools & Liblaries: Python 3, Numpy, Matplotlib
